Gnome terminal is a bit of a jerk and does not save settings in a local dotfile which makes it super annoying to do this. 

So you have to use dconf to dump and then import the settings:

dconf dump /org/gnome/terminal/ > gnome_terminal_settings.txt

And then

dconf load /org/gnome/terminal/ < gnome_terminal_settings.txt
